# assignment 9.4
##Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
##and figure out who has sent the greatest number of
##mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines
##and takes the second word of those lines as the
##person who sent the mail. The program creates a
##Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail
##address to a count of the number of times they
##appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced,
##the program reads through the dictionary using a
##maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

# given code for file entry shortcut
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

# my code
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip() # remove whitespace
    if line.startswith('From '): # only want emails that are received and not sent
        words = line.split() # split the line into words
        # grab the email address and count them
        if words[1] in counts:
            counts[words[1]] = counts.get(words[1],0) + 1
        else:
            counts[words[1]] = 1

most_word_count = None
most_word = None
for word, count in counts.items():
    if most_word_count is None or count > most_word_count:
        most_word = word
        most_word_count = count

print(most_word, most_word_count)
