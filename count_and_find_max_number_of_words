# assignment 9.4
##Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
##and figure out who has sent the greatest number of
##mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines
##and takes the second word of those lines as the
##person who sent the mail. The program creates a
##Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail
##address to a count of the number of times they
##appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced,
##the program reads through the dictionary using a
##maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

# given code for file entry shortcut
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

# my code
# create an empty dictionary
counts = dict()

# write a for loop to iterate through the lines of the text file
for x in y:
    ...

# a good idea is to remove whitespace
.rstrip() 

# create a conditional statement to only look for the lines that start with 'From ' *** the space is important since 'From:' exists
.startswith('From '): 

# split those lines we want into words
.split()

# without using a regex grab the email address that is in the second position of the line and count them

        if words[1] in counts:
            counts[words[1]] = counts.get(words[1],0) + 1
        else:
            counts[words[1]] = 1
            
 # build a for loop to iterate through the dictionary to build a histogram of words

most_word_count = None
most_word = None
for word, count in counts.items():

# print the results
print(most_word, most_word_count)
